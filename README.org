* Parapheursh


Produces a digital signature of the text of a pdf file and prints it
over a chosen page of the pdf file with a chosen background.

*Don't use it on non-text pdf (digitalized documents)*. Only the text
as obtained by ~pdftotext~ is signed.

** Requirements
~apt-get install openssl imagemagick latex~

a pair of asymetric keys as typically obtained by:
~cd ~/.ssh/ ; ssh-keygen -f parapheur.rsa~

** Usage
~parapheur.sh file.pdf~
| Option      | meaning                                                             |

| =-h=        | shows this help                                                     |
| =-p n=      | the page where to place the signature default to 1                  |
| =-k key=    | the private key file default to /Users/boudes/.ssh/parapheur.rsa    |
| =-x xshift= | the horizontal shift of the signature from center default 4cm       |
| =-y yshift= | the vertical shift of the signature from center default -6cm        |
| =-w width=  | width of the signature in pixels default 960                        |
| =-l width=  | the same as -w                                                      |
| =-g image=  | the background image on which the digital signature will be printed |
|             | (default to =~/Documents/img/paris13_aile_960.png=)                 |



** How does it works
It is a very simple shell script mainly written a sunday morning:
1. it extracts the text of the pdf file with ~pdftotext~
2. it hashes and sign this text with ~openssl~ using a given private key
3. it creates an image with that signature on a chosen background
   (typically a manuscript signature)
4. It prints the image on a given page of the pdf file producing a new
   file (suffix =_signed.pdf=)
