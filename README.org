* Parapheursh


Produces a digital signature of the text of a pdf file (say
=file.pdf=) and prints it as an image over a chosen page of the pdf
file with a chosen background, without changing the text of the pdf,
so the new file, =file_signed.pdf=, as the same signature.

*Don't use it on non-text pdf (digitalized documents)*. Only the text
as obtained by ~pdftotext~ is signed.

** Requirements
~apt-get install openssl imagemagick latex~

a pair of asymetric keys as typically obtained by:
~cd ~/.ssh/ ; ssh-keygen -f parapheur_rsa~

** Usage
~parapheur.sh file.pdf~
| Option      | meaning                                                             |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =-h=        | shows this help                                                     |
| =-p n=      | the page where to place the signature default to 1                  |
| =-k key=    | the private key file default to =~/.ssh/parapheur_rsa=              |
| =-x xshift= | the horizontal shift of the signature from center default 4cm       |
| =-y yshift= | the vertical shift of the signature from center default -6cm        |
| =-w width=  | width of the signature in pixels default 960                        |
| =-l width=  | the same as -w                                                      |
| =-g image=  | the background image on which the digital signature will be printed |
|             | (default to =~/img/paris13_aile_960.png=)                           |
| =-t=        | also produce a text file containing the digital signature           |


** How it works
Parapheursh is a very simple shell script mainly written a sunday morning:
1. it extracts the text of the pdf file with ~pdftotext~
2. it hashes and signs this text with ~openssl~ using a given private key
3. it creates an image with that signature on a chosen background
   (typically a manuscript signature)
4. It prints the image on a given page of the pdf file producing a new
   file (suffix =_signed.pdf=)

** What to do next
 This is not a certified digital signature, but the process is
 reasonably secure. You can publish your public key over the internet and
 anyone wanting to verify that you really signed a given pdf file and that
 its text has not been alterated can
 do it in a few steps. First she has to recover the digital signature
 as a text file in the format a chain of pairs of characters
 separated by colons. This is the fastidious part (you may want to
 ease it by providing the signature as a separated text file).
